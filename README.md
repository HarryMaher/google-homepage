#'Google' Homepage Clone

###*Harry Maher*

This my a clone of Google's homepage (in Nepal, but the English version because those fonts are safer.) The project is from The Odin Project's [curriculum].(http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

###Instructions
Clone this repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/HarryMaher/google-homepage
```
Open index.html then put in a search term (or keep the suggested search) and click "search." It'll do the search for you on Bing.
